# Enhancing-Open-Stope-Stability-Prediction
The aim of this project is to introduce new machine learning techniques into the field of open stope stability analysis: By integrating the classification model, genetic programming and Kriging techniques into a platform, a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) is created to provide decision-making references.
